Our Chilled Water Buffer Tank American Wheatley Chilled Water Buffer Tanks are designed for water systems with insufficient water volume capacity, in relation to the chiller capacity. The chiller costs less to purchase and install than other chillers in its class, and operates quietly and efficiently. Under normal conditions a chilled-water storage tank is always filled with water. It operates on the premise of storing thermal energy, typically in the form of chilled water, during off-peak hours, when energy costs and demands are low. Traditional cold water storage tanks, also known as loft header tanks or feed and expansion tanks are available in a wide range of capacities and cistern types such as low level tanks, open top and enclosed cold water tanks. Warm and chilled water enters and exits the tank through diffusers located at the top and bottom of the tank. The practical minimum storage volume for chilled water is approximately 10.7 cubic feet per ton-hour at a 20F tem - perature difference. This results in fewer cycles of the compressor and better temperature control. Cemline Chilled Water Buffer Tanks (CWB) are designed to be used with chillers which do not have water volumes of sufficient size in relation to the chiller. Chilled Water Buffer Tanks Our buffer tanks are designed to increase a chiller system&#x27;s capacity so water temperatures stabilize within the chiller manufacturers recommendations.
