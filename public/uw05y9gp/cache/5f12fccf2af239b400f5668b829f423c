At the point of the cut, a small amount of the material is pulled through that groove, resulting in a tail on the pellet. These results highlight the importance of a balanced aggregation strength between the donor and acceptor polymers to achieve high-performance all-PSCs with optimal active layer film morphology.  Amorphous vs. Semi-crystalline Polymers. The Importance of Melt & Mold Temperature. Silicone resins can be combined with many organic polymers, and this makes it possible to tailor a large number of properties to the intended application, e.g.  The product being milled should determine the most desirable properties required of your grinding media. Coatings; Silicone; Nylon (PA)  Avoid Weathershield, Sandtex, Stormdry - any 'protective masonry coatings'. Low abrasion resistant. Injection Molding Material Alternatives Guide.
