Some types of tissue are more prone to certain kinds of artifacts.  Pathology is the study of diseases, especially in the context of their structural and functional alterations.  Troubleshoot by process of elimination, from least labor intensive to the most involved solution to the problem. The classic pancreaticoduodenectomy is an effective treat- ment for both malignant and benign diseases involving the head of the pancreas, distal common bile duct, ampulla of Vater and duodenum. Histology staining is the most common and effective method for evaluating the degree of decellularization of the materials. These artifacts may occur during surgical removal, fixation, processing, embedding, microtomy and staining procedures. The processing of specimen for medical information is subject to a procedure that results in a tissue fit for diagnosis and interpretation. This paper attempts to put together all the facts regarding the various artifacts that are encountered in histopathology. The intent of this article is to assist pathologists inexperienced in examining central nervous system (CNS) sections to recognize normal and abnormal cell types as well as some common artifacts. Artifacts in histopathology i.e. Pre-analytical aspects  What is the most common type of artifact? It is the second most common cause of death from cancer among women in the world.  DEFINITION An artefact (Latin &#x27;ars&#x27;- art + &#x27;factum&#x27;- made) in histology means any non-natural feature or structure accidentally introduced into something being observed or studied According to Bernstein, Artefact refers to &quot;An artificial structure or tissue alteration on a prepared microscopic slide caused by some extraneous factors 3. COMMON ARTIFACTS AND REMEDIES IN HISTOPATHOLOGY (A REVIEW) Ekundina Vo, G. Eze Published 31 January 2015 Medicine The essence of preparing a biological specimen for microscopic studies is to get adequate and accurate medical information that is a true representation of the specimen, be it for research or diagnostic purposes.   Verifying that the correct processing program was used is a simple solution, compared to changing out all of the processing reagents. It is therefore essential to identify the commonly occurring artifacts during histopathological interpretations of tissue sections.  Starting with the simplest solution first not only takes the least effort, but may save a lot of time. Increase temperature of water bath results into expansion of tissue beyond its limit and &quot;Parched Earth (crackes)&quot; effect is noted. Chatter and micro-vibration: Parallel tears or fractures in tissue (shown in the upper image); some tissue may be splintering out (shattering) Basic requirements for arriving at a conclusive diagnosis include correct biopsy procedure, proper fixation and processing techniques, adequate sectioning and staining. These artifacts may occur during surgical removal, fixation, tissue processing, embedding and microtomy and staining and mounting procedures.  There is always the possibility that an error in diagnosis can give rise to damage accountability and the signature on the histology report will sanction that diagnosis. We are not allowed to display external PDFs yet.  Dark neurons are the most common histologic artifact but, with experience, can readily be distinguished from degenerating (eosinophilic) neurons. Muscle (electromyogram) activity Abstract Histopathology is the science of slide analysis for the diagnostic and research purposes. Defects are common in this lengthy procedure and they are referred as Artifact.Accuracy of the histopathological diagnosis depends on eliminating or minimizing the artifact in histological section. Identifying which tissues will lead to certain artifacts will allow for preventive measures rather than corrective actions. Medical Histology is the microscopic study of tissues and organs through sectioning, staining, and examining those sections under a microscope.  Technical problems and troubleshooting Specimen receive and registration  Grossing  Fixation  Processing  embedding  staining .  Artifacts. In some cases, a cause of death may be evident from microscopic tissue examination. Introduction: The word &#x27;artifact&#x27; is derived from the latin words, &#x27;Ars&#x27; (art) &amp; &#x27;factum&#x27;(made). An artifact can be defined as unrelated, self-colored artificial feature found in tissue sections. They can even lead to complete uselessness of the tissue. Wolf recently collaborated with 17 other fish pathologists in a Toxicologic Pathology review article that describes and illustrates some common diagnostic misinterpretations evident in the peer-reviewed fish literature, and makes recommendations for improving the quality of papers that publish fish histopathology data. Alcoholic (solution) A solution in which the solvent is water; watery. However, sometimes the presence of certain artefacts in a microscopic section can result in. artifacts combination knife and electrical points. It is therefore essential to identify the commonly occurring artifacts during histopathological interpretations of tissue sections.

COMMON ARTIFACTS AND REMEDIES IN HISTOPATHOLOGY (A REVIEW) Ekundina VO1, Eze G2 1.   Artifacts are then sorted according to type of material, e.g., stone, ceramic, metal, glass, or bone, and after that into subgroups based on similarities in shape, manner of decoration, or method of manufacture.  . Histopathology: Samples of tumors and peripheral nerves of animals freshly killed should be collected and fixed in buffered formalin at 10% for an adequate histopathological evaluation.  Two criteria are evaluated by histopathologists - distribution of lesions and characteristics of the tumor cells. Aimakhume A. Artifacts in histology: A 1- the least common artifact in our study. These artifacts may occur during surgical removal, fixation, tissue processing, embedding and microtomy and staining and mounting procedures. . They can even lead to complete uselessness of the tissue. Below is a summary of the most common problems that can be identified at the microtome. Often called microscopic anatomy and histochemistry, histology allows for the visualization of tissue structure and characteristic changes the tissue may have undergone.  Excessive workload and human error are often common factors for potential in diagnostic fallibility.  They lead to misinterpretation of histopathological diagnosis but at times they throw limelight into diagnosis. Histology is a field of biology and medicine dedicated to elucidating tissue structure, function, and disease states.  RAPSODI registers corresponding histopathology and MRI slices. Subtle/equivocal or &#x27;absence&#x27; of in-life phenotype is common in mutant mice. 3.Floaters Artifacts are pieces of tissues that appear on slide that do not belong there, they have floated during processing or due to dirty uncleaned water bath.  Designing a quality control and assurance plan in histopathology should focus on three elements: (1) pre-analytical phase, (2) the analytical phase and (3) the post-analytical phase [ 2] as defects may occur at any of these phases, resulting in an erroneous diagnosis. The study was undertaken to know the prevalence and . And it is also the first choice to evaluate the maintenance of the ECM structure and degree of decellularization.67 Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining, which is the simplest and time-honored .
