Cancer stem cells (CSCs) contribute to the initiation, recurrence, and metastasis of cancer; however, there are still no drugs targeting CSCs in clinical application.

Wnt signaling is also activated in cholangiocarcinoma, but genomic alternations of major Wnt pathway components are rare, with the exception of RNF43.
