VLC offers high bandwidth as well as immunity to interference from other electromagnetic spectrums. Normal photodiodes have 3 pins: ground, vcc and a signal pin.   Laser-based communication can pack a lot more data and deliver data packages at far faster speeds than radio waves, and at tremendous bandwidths that require no compression. Laser communications are better than radio as light wavelengths are packed much more tightly than the sound waves and they transmit more information per second with a stronger signal, Lasers are used in communication with the optical fibers instead of telephone cables.    Our goal was to maintain parity with the expanding requirements of long-distance communications links and improve transmission bandwidth. Both laser communication terminals are one-unit designs with electrical (external) harnesses only. Missiles Satellites that use lasers to exchange data promise to make military communications faster and harder to intercept  if the Pentagon can figure out how to make them work. These LCTs make over 60 satellite-to-satellite links over a distance of 45,000 km per day and have logged over 30,000 links total.

The short link distance terminal has a footprint of 500500mm and a height above the satellite&#x27;s panel of 420mm and depth below of 200mm. Inter-satellite links and the on-board processing are the key technologies to achieve this goal, but the new network architecture leads to great challenges on satellite routing. We used laser torches which can transmit the light up to the distance of 500 meters. 1. Command, control, intelligence and reconnaissance capabilities require reliable means of sharing data with remote units. The TeraByte InfraRed Delivery (TBIRD) system will showcase the high-data-rate capabilities of laser communications from a small satellite in low-Earth orbit.  . Laser communication is one of the key areas in wireless Communications.  This means IR is undetectable to the human eye - perfect for wireless communication. or conventions), or space based communications. The Space Development Agency says optical inter-satellite links are &quot;one of the most critical technologies to be demonstrated.&quot; WASHINGTON  Optical communications terminals that use lasers to beam data across space will be tested in upcoming experiments by the Space Development Agency and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Comparison with previous laser-based VLC implementations shows that the path-loss optimization helps achieve gigabit-class communication at practically relevant link lengths and the lowest illuminance levels thus far reported. The proposed system is a four-colour multiplexed high-speed. An infrared laser can carry information in a similar way to radio waves. It consists in development and demonstration of a metrology system that carries out time &amp; frequency (or distance) measurements based on a high-debit FSO telecom link. Laser communications are key to ensuring fast and precise transmission of data from spacecraft systems, which offers the unique advantages over radio frequency (RF) systems, including size, mass,. Space Based Communication Figure 2 Laser communication system can be used to transmit sound and data signals through the laser beam of the system.  This technology can also be helpful for Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations like Starlink because data can be transmitted between satellites in the same plane , which can lessen the burden on . Another method for this communication is by using Blue-Green laser. The setup is rather simple: The engineers took a red and green laser pointer, wired in a 500Mbps data stream into each, and simply pointed them at photodiode receptors.
