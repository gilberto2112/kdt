VIBRATION RESISTANT FASTENERS ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSUREA self-locking fastener having a bearing surface comprising a plurality of sets of serrations arranged to penetrate a workpiece such that,. This technology utilizes tension, rather than traditionally-used friction, to secure fastened joints in high vibration and load applications. Spiralock Vibration Loosening Resistance Vibration Loosening Resistance Test Parameters: &quot;-28 nut run @ 20 Hz with 0.033&quot; amplitude of transverse movement. anti-loosening bolt PLB v2 Throughout their lifetime, fasteners are affected from vibrations. A locking fastener is designed to resist loosening and can be externally threaded, such as a screw, or internally threaded, like a nut. Removable with heat and hand tools.

Withstands stress and wind vibration with specialty designed reinforcement ribs.  The 4-inch and 5.5-inch LED work lights emit 2,000 or 5,600 raw lumens of cool white light, in a 36-degree spot beam pattern, and consume just 30 or 80 watts. {0} variants (Filters applied) {0} variants (No filters applied . High isolation efficiency for vibration and shock forces, and reduction of transmitted sound.   316 stainless . 316 1018-1022 Torque.  Cite. 99 ($6.25/Item) Temp range -65 to 300 degrees F. Cure speed 60 min.  Loctite 248 adhesive (with Loctite 7088 primer) Loctite, one of the most common anti-vibration methods, is an anaerobic adhesive that works by gluing the male and female threads together. It can happen that bolts were never tightened properly to begin with, which means the joint lacks clamp force.
