Currently, 40% of soil in Africa is degraded. Here, this inexpensive resource is the main cooking fuel for urban populations and, as these grow and demand for charcoal increases, deforestation intensifies.  Trees absorb groundwater and release the same into the atmosphere during transpiration.  While a long-standing hypothesis argues that changes in fire regimes and grazing patterns cause woody plant encroachment at a regional scale, a more recent alternative holds the post-industrial rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) responsible.  Deforestation causes approximately $2 trillion to $4.5 trillion in lost biodiversity each year. Agriculture is responsible for approximately 80% of tropical forest loss. When forests are cleared for development and to meet the demand for wood supply, the soil is loosened in the process. The causes of woody plant encroachment in South Africa are debated.   2.    Deforestation is a significant contributor to global warming in South Africa and elsewhere.  Climate change is also causing an increase in water evaporation from the soil, making it very difficult for produce in Southern Africa. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) defines deforestation as the permanent conversion of the world&#x27;s forest areas to other non-forested land uses such as agriculture, animal grazing, urbanization, as well as to obtain wood for fuel, manufacturing, and construction activities. Illegal logging causes forest degradation and is too often the first link in a chain of events that can result in total deforestation.

The recent dynamic in SSA varies from dry to wet biomes. Fuel wood collection in developing . Causes of deforestation Farming, grazing of livestock, mining, and drilling combined account for more than half of all deforestation. Degraded soil diminishes food production and leads to soil erosion, which in turn contributes to desertification.This is particularly worrisome since, according to the UN&#x27;s Food and Agriculture Organization, some 83% of sub-Saharan African people depend on the land for their livelihood, and food production in Africa will have to . Between 2010 and 2020, South America lost an average of 2.6 million hectares of forest per year, according the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Quick Navigation for The Major Causes and Effects of Desertification CAUSES 1. The fourth leading cause is wildfires. 3. When rain washes the loosened top soil into streams, sediments pollute waterways.   The majority of our energy in South Africa comes from the burning of coal at power stations and results in greatly increased emissions of sulphur and nitrogen oxides in to the atmosphere. Deforestation and cropping are also very harmful and the second largest causes contributing to land degradation.   Timber Logging  Africa itself is located in an area where climate is unpredictable, making them vulnerable to climate change and while Southern Africa is semi-arid, it puts them at risk for desertification . Africa&#x27;s tropical forests, which include the Congo Basin, are under constant threat. The main cause of deforestation is agriculture (poorly planned infrastructure is emerging as a big threat too) and the main cause of forest degradation is illegal logging.  From policymakers to companies to consumers, urgent action is needed to halt forest loss. Unsustainable water management 5.
